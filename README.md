In my portfolio project, Briantech Pizza website, I showcased my proficiency in front-end development using React. Leveraging Material UI, I crafted a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for pizza lovers to explore a diverse menu, including pepperoni, margherita, pineapple, vegan pizza, and our signature Briantech pizza. By effectively managing state and props, I ensured a seamless user experience, allowing customers to customize orders and view pricing based on pizza types. The project exemplifies my skills in React, design, and responsiveness, demonstrating my ability to create engaging web applications that cater to various tastes.
